            <h1>The Solar System</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>Introduction to the Solar System</h2>
        <p>
           The solar system is a vast collection of celestial bodies that orbit around the Sun,
           which is a star located at the center. It includes eight major planets, their moons,
           dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other space objects. The Sun's gravity keeps
           all these bodies in orbit, making it the dominant force in the solar system. 
           Formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a cloud of gas and dust, the solar system
           continues to evolve and fascinate scientists. 
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>The Planets</h2>
        <p>
            There are eight recognized planets in the solar system, divided into two main groups: 
            the inner rocky planets and the outer gas and ice giants. The four inner planets—Mercury, 
            Venus, Earth, and Mars—are solid and relatively small. The four outer planets—Jupiter, 
            Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are much larger, with thick atmospheres and many moons. 
            Each planet has unique features, such as rings, storms, and varying surface conditions.
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Other Celestial Bodies</h2>
        <p>
            Beyond the planets, the solar system contains many other interesting objects. Dwarf 
            planets like Pluto, Ceres, and Eris orbit the Sun but do not meet all the criteria 
            to be classified as full-fledged planets. There is also the asteroid belt between Mars 
            and Jupiter, home to thousands of rocky bodies, and the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud, 
            which contain icy objects and comets. These bodies help scientists understand the early 
            history of the solar system.
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Importance and Exploration</h2>
        <p>
           Studying the solar system helps us learn about Earth's place in the universe and the potential 
           for life elsewhere. Space missions like Voyager, Mars rovers, and telescopes have provided 
           detailed images and data about planets and other bodies. As technology advances, future 
           missions may explore moons, asteroids, or even send humans to Mars. The solar system is not 
           just a subject of science—it's a source of wonder, discovery, and endless curiosity.
